# AICompose

This is an independent project I developed for Topics in Programming. The core of the project is graphical, in the display of the staff, notes, accidentals, etc. but it is also functional.
Whenever you run the project, it generates a random melody based off of a given bassline that follows basic 2-part counterpoint harmonic rules.
Click SPACE once the project has loaded to play the melody with damped sin waves.
The melodies don't sound great, but if I were to continue working on this project I would include logic for predicted chords and avoid jumps in the right hand.

To run, use java -jar AICompose.jar

Or run Launcher.java from a JRE.
